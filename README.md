## Introduction

SASS is a powerful CSS pre-processor that allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with SASS, where I experiment with different features and techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, you will need to have SASS installed on your local machine. Follow the instructions below to install SASS and clone this repository.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Install SASS globally using npm:

    ```sh
    npm install -g sass
    ```

2. Clone this repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/saksham0712/Sass/tree/master
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd sass-practice
    ```

## Projects

Here are some of the projects and exercises you will find in this repository:

- **Project 1: Variables and Nesting**
  - Practicing the use of SASS variables and nesting rules to create a clean and maintainable stylesheet.

- **Project 2: Mixins and Functions**
  - Utilizing mixins and functions to create reusable styles and streamline CSS development.

- **Project 3: Partials and Import**
  - Organizing SASS code into partials and using the `@import` directive to modularize stylesheets.

- **Project 4: Extends and Inheritance**
  - Demonstrating the use of `@extend` and inheritance to avoid code duplication and maintain consistency.

## Usage

Each project directory contains its own `README.md` with specific instructions on how to compile and use the SASS files. Generally, you can compile SASS to CSS using the following command:

```sh
sass input.scss output.css
```
Replace input.scss with the path to the SASS file you want to compile, and output.css with the desired output file path.
